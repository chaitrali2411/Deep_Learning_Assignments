# Age Prediction at CU Denver Ð Kaggle CompetitionThis repository contains the code for the Kaggle competition [Age Prediction Spring 25 at CU Denver](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/age-prediction-spring-25-at-cu-denver/). The goal is to develop a deep learning model to predict the age of subjects based on the provided dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).## Getting StartedFollow these steps to set up and run the project:1. **Clone the Repository & Download Dataset**     - Clone this repository:     ```bash     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/age-prediction-cu-denver.git     cd age-prediction-cu-denver     ```   - Download the competition dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/age-prediction-spring-25-at-cu-denver/) and place the files in the appropriate directory as expected by the notebook.2. **Set Up Your Environment**     - Create a virtual environment:     ```bash     python -m venv env     ```   - Activate the virtual environment:     - On Linux/Mac:       ```bash       source env/bin/activate       ```     - On Windows:       ```bash       env\Scripts\activate       ```   - Install the required packages:     ```bash     pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn tensorflow     ```     *(Replace `tensorflow` with `torch` if you are using PyTorch.)*3. **Run the Notebook**     - Launch Jupyter Notebook:     ```bash     jupyter notebook DL_HW2_CNN.ipynb     ```   - Open and execute the notebook cells sequentially to load the data, preprocess it, build and train the CNN model, and evaluate the results.   - Adjust parameters (learning rate, epochs, batch size, etc.) as needed within the notebook.4. **Submit Your Predictions**     - Once you have generated predictions, follow the Kaggle competition guidelines to create your submission file and upload it to the competition platform.## OverviewThe notebook (`DL_HW2_CNN.ipynb`) covers:- **Data Loading & Preprocessing:** Reading and cleaning the dataset with necessary transformations.- **Model Building:** Constructing the CNN architecture for age prediction.- **Training:** Compiling the model, setting up the training loop, and optimizing with appropriate loss functions.- **Evaluation & Visualization:** Assessing model performance through plots (loss/accuracy curves) and metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error).- **Conclusion:** Summarizing findings and suggesting areas for further improvement.## LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
